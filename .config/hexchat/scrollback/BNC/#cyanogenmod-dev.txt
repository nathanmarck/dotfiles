T 1393920490 18<JC_Yang18>	I'm here to confirm that is an official support device a requirement as the first CM build that I can make before I try port it to a new device? I think only building the rom is ok without an official support device, am I right? or we really need the device to get some proprietary stuff such as drivers or whatever from it? I'm considering to port CM and don't own an official support device.
T 1393920601 18<PlayfulGod18>	unless the device in mention is a clone of, or very close to a supported device
