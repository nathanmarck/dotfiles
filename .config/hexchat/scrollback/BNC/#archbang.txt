T 1394219301 18<ReemZ18>	hi all, just started playing with archbang, live, but can't seem to find the passwords (specifically root) for the live envo, and entering 'root' or no password in 'su' results in a failed auth so I'm guessing I do need to enter one...
T 1394219726 18<AHD4218>	try: sudo bash
T 1394219812 18<ReemZ18>	thanks mate but is there a way of not using sudo? I'm rather used to su
T 1394219850 18<AHD4218>	well..when you have the sudo bash, you can try passwd
T 1394219860 18<AHD4218>	then su
T 1394219875 18<AHD4218>	dunno if it works in a live environment
T 1394219882 18<ReemZ18>	true, which is one of the reasons I'm not too fond of sudo ;)
T 1394219920 18<ReemZ18>	was just a bit surprised to find su requiring a password but not finding that password on the website, which may say more about me than about the website hehehe

T 1394219941 18<ReemZ18>	so far, playing with it live is fun though
T 1394219942 18<AHD4218>	i would have tried, but i accidently deleted the archbang vm
T 1394219953 18<ReemZ18>	I know nothing about Openbox but this is insanely fast

T 1394219972 18<AHD4218>	openbox is a bit too minimalistic for me. i use xfce

T 1394220055 18<AHD4218>	you should try the manjaro kde community edtition

T 1394220078 18<AHD4218>	got it in a vm.. surprisingly fast too
T 1394220167 18<ReemZ18>	got Chakra on the list to try as well btw, and I could go straight Arch, haven't made up my mind yet, but I am thinking hard of leaving my main distro of years and so far the Arches seem to be good candidates...
