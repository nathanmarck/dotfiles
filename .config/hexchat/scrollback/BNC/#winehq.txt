T 1394530927 18<nandersson18>	Hi, in earlier versions of Wine we have experienced some trouble with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) - Wine did some changes to the PAM-files. In recent versions of Wine we havn't seen those changes, which is very good, becuase Wine used to mess up our Kerberos-auth. Will things stay calm? Does anybody know why Wine interfered with PAM in the first place?
