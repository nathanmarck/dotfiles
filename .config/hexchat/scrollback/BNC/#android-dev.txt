T 1393976666 18<rgr18>	I dont want to go the gradle route. I dont want to be limited to only Android apps. AS is a direct fork off idea. For the purposes of developing "first apps" AS doesnt offer much - I dont need its "smarter" project set up ( I did try it and gradle made a right screw up of dependency management and downloads).

T 1393976949 18<rgr18>	AS is there for a reason : one is easier Android app configuration. Admittedly I tried it a month ago. It offered nothign in terms of development or debugging that isnt in IDEA community edition from what I can see.
