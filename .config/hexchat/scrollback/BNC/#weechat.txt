T 1394544898 18<tomoe-mami18>	FlashCode: actually i want the host to always appear on screen but a tag is fine too. can i request a modifier for changing stuff on screen only? i have a script that appends custom label at the end of message (something like this: http://i.imgur.com/jtlfPpd.png [the bottom one]). it's using modifier weechat_print so it's saved to log too.
T 1394544923 18<tomoe-mami18>	might be nice if it's only appear on screen
T 1394544943 18<FlashCode18>	tomoe-mami: I looked to do that, but it's hard to do without slowing down display

T 1394544986 18<FlashCode18>	but I agree this would be nice
T 1394545033 18<Nei18>	iirc you can print a message that wont get logged
T 1394545047 18<Nei18>	so you can filter the original message
T 1394545069 18<Nei18>	or I think you can use a hdata_update on the lines
T 1394545079 18<Nei18>	that wouldnt get logged
T 1394545083 18<FlashCode18>	true too
T 1394545099 18<FlashCode18>	but anyway a modifier would be even better

T 1394545156 18<FlashCode18>	Nei: logging is just a hook_print
